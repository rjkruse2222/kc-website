# Questions from Claude (Please Answer)

## Content Questions

1. **Hero Image**: The current tax-strategy-hero.jpg shows a night sky with stars. Is this the image you want for the Ken Burns effect, or would you prefer a different image (e.g., professional/business setting)?

2. **Case Studies**: The current placeholder case studies are:
   - Manufacturing: Entity Restructuring ($127K saved)
   - Technology: R&D Credits ($89K saved)
   - Real Estate: Cost Segregation ($64K saved)

   Do you want to keep these industries/strategies, or replace them entirely with your real case studies?

3. **Guarantee Language**: I used "Your tax savings will exceed your investment in our services—or we make it right." Is this the exact guarantee you offer, or should the wording be different?

4. **Monthly Fee**: You mentioned monthly fees start at $250. Is this a separate ongoing advisory fee, or part of the initial engagement? Should I clarify this in the FAQ?

5. **Services V1**: You selected Services V1 (Magazine Editorial). Should I move this to the main `/services` page, or keep it at the preview URL for now?

## Design Questions

6. **Case Study Whitepaper Style**: I designed the case studies with a clean, document-like layout with sidebar. Is this the "old school whitepaper" style you had in mind, or did you want something different (e.g., more academic, downloadable PDF style)?

7. **Tax Strategy V2**: You mentioned trying a couple different versions. Should I create a V2 with a different design approach after you review V1?

## Process Questions

8. **Process Steps**: I expanded to 6 steps:
   1. Discovery
   2. Create Your Tax Plan
   3. Implement the Plan
   4. Quarterly Check-ins
   5. Tax Preparation (included)
   6. Ongoing Monitoring

   Does this accurately reflect your process? Any steps to add/remove/rename?

9. **Pricing Tiers**: Should I add any mention of different service tiers (e.g., business only, individual only, combined business + individual)?

10. **Client Testimonials**: Would you like to add client quotes to the case studies? If so, please provide any testimonials you have permission to use.
