Your business is growing. Financial complexity is increasing. You need CFO-level strategic guidance, but does that mean hiring a full-time executive?

For most growing businesses, the answer is no. At least not yet.

Here's how to decide between a full-time CFO and outsourced (fractional) CFO services.

## The Cost Reality

Let's start with the numbers.

**Full-Time CFO Costs (2025)**

- Base salary: $200,000 - $350,000
- Benefits, equity, and bonuses: Add 30-50%
- Total compensation packages: $350,000 - $500,000 annually

That doesn't include recruiting costs (often 20-30% of first-year salary), onboarding time, or the risk of a bad hire.

**Fractional CFO Costs (2025)**

- Hourly rates: $175 - $350/hour
- Monthly retainers: $3,000 - $10,000
- Annual cost: $16,800 - $120,000 depending on engagement level

Most early-stage companies need 8-10 hours of CFO support monthly. That's $1,400 - $3,500 per month, or roughly $20,000 - $40,000 annually.

The savings: 80-90% compared to a full-time hire.

## When Each Option Makes Sense

**Fractional CFO is Right When:**

- **Revenue Under $15 Million:** Most businesses at this stage don't have enough financial complexity to keep a full-time CFO occupied. You need strategic guidance, not 40+ hours per week of CFO time.
- **Specific Project Needs:** Fundraising, financial restructuring, system implementations, or preparing for an acquisition benefit from experienced guidance without permanent overhead.
- **Scaling Operations:** You're growing but not ready for the commitment of a C-suite hire. A fractional CFO can build the financial infrastructure you'll need.
- **Testing the Role:** Not sure exactly what you need? Working with a fractional CFO helps you define the role before committing to a full-time search.

**Full-Time CFO is Right When:**

- **Revenue Exceeds $25 Million:** At this level, financial complexity typically justifies dedicated leadership.
- **Daily Strategic Decisions:** If major financial decisions happen multiple times per day and require immediate input, you need someone in the building.
- **Investor or Board Requirements:** Some funding sources require a full-time CFO as part of the deal terms.
- **Building a Leadership Team:** If you're assembling a complete executive team, a full-time CFO plays a different role than an outside advisor.

## Beyond the Cost Savings

Fractional CFOs offer advantages beyond price:

- **Immediate Value:** Full-time hires need 3-6 months to fully onboard and understand your business. Experienced fractional CFOs bring proven frameworks and deliver value from day one.
- **Diverse Experience:** A fractional CFO works with multiple businesses across industries. They bring best practices from a variety of situations. A full-time CFO may only have deep experience in one or two companies.
- **No Overhead Burden:** Fractional CFOs provide their own tools, software, and professional development. No equipment costs, no office space requirements.
- **Flexibility:** Scale up during busy periods (fundraising, audits, year-end). Scale down when things are stable. Try restructuring that with an employee.
- **Reduced Risk:** If the relationship isn't working, changing fractional providers is far simpler than terminating an executive.

## What a Good Fractional CFO Provides

Expect more than number-crunching:

- **Strategic Financial Planning:** Long-term financial modeling, scenario analysis, and growth planning.
- **Cash Flow Management:** Forecasting, working capital optimization, and treasury management.
- **Fundraising Support:** Pitch deck financials, investor materials, due diligence preparation.
- **Financial Systems:** Implementing accounting software, establishing KPIs, building dashboards.
- **Team Development:** Mentoring your bookkeeper or controller to grow into more responsibility.
- **Board and Investor Relations:** Preparing materials and attending meetings as your financial expert.

## Making the Transition

Many companies start with fractional CFO services and eventually hire full-time.

A good fractional CFO will:

- Help you define the full-time role when you're ready
- Build systems that a full-time CFO can inherit
- Assist with the hiring process
- Support the transition period

Some even convert from fractional to full-time if both parties want to continue the relationship.

## The Bottom Line

For businesses under $25 million in revenue, a fractional CFO almost always makes more financial sense than a full-time hire.

You get experienced strategic guidance at a fraction of the cost, with flexibility to scale as your needs evolve.

Save the full-time CFO hire for when your business truly demands dedicated executive leadership. Until then, fractional services deliver better value.
