Under the Augusta Rule (Section 280A(g)), you can rent your home to your S-Corporation for up to 14 days per year and receive the rental income completely tax-free.

This legitimate tax strategy allows business owners to create additional income while generating a deduction for the corporation.

## How It Works

Section 280A(g) of the tax code allows homeowners to rent their residence for up to 14 days per year without reporting the rental income. When your S-Corporation holds legitimate business meetings or events at your home, it can pay you fair market rent.

The result:

- You receive tax-free rental income (up to 14 days)
- Your corporation gets a business expense deduction
- The net effect reduces overall tax burden

## Requirements for Compliance

To withstand IRS scrutiny, you must meet these requirements:

**Have Legitimate Business Purpose**

The rental must be for actual business activities:

- Board meetings
- Strategic planning sessions
- Employee training
- Client meetings
- Company retreats

**Charge Fair Market Rent**

The rental rate must be reasonable. Research comparable venues in your area:

- Hotel conference room rates
- Executive meeting space rentals
- Event venue pricing

Document how you determined the rate.

**Maintain Proper Documentation**

Keep records of:

- Meeting dates and duration
- Business purpose of each meeting
- Attendees
- Meeting agendas and minutes
- Rental agreements
- Payment records

**Follow Corporate Formalities**

The corporation should:

- Have a written rental agreement
- Issue payment by check (create paper trail)
- Document the arrangement in board minutes

## Example Scenario

Your S-Corporation holds monthly board meetings at your home (12 meetings per year). Local executive meeting space rents for $500 per day.

- Annual rent: 12 days x $500 = $6,000
- Corporation deducts $6,000 as business expense
- You receive $6,000 tax-free (under 14-day limit)

If your effective tax rate is 30%, you've saved $1,800 in taxes.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Exceeding 14 Days:** Once you pass 14 days, ALL rental income becomes taxable
- **Inflated Rent:** Unreasonable rates invite IRS challenge
- **Poor Documentation:** Without records, the deduction may be disallowed
- **No Business Purpose:** Personal use disguised as business use is tax fraud

## Is This Right for You?

This strategy works best for S-Corporation owners who:

- Regularly hold business meetings
- Have adequate space at home for meetings
- Are willing to maintain proper documentation
- Want to maximize legitimate tax deductions

## The Bottom Line

The Augusta Rule provides a legitimate way to shift income from taxable to tax-free while creating a business deduction. Like all tax strategies, proper execution and documentation are essential.

Consult with your CPA before implementing to ensure compliance with current tax law.
