Many business owners assume R&D tax credits are only for pharmaceutical companies or tech giants with massive research labs. That assumption costs them thousands in missed tax savings every year.

The reality? If your business develops new products, improves processes, or solves technical problems, you likely qualify for the Research and Development Tax Credit under IRC Section 41.

## What Qualifies as R&D?

The IRS uses a four-part test to determine if your activities qualify:

### 1. Section 174 Test

Your work must involve expenditures to resolve uncertainty related to developing or improving a product or process within your trade or business.

### 2. Technological in Nature

The research must rely on hard sciences: engineering, computer science, biological science, or physical science.

### 3. Business Component Test

Your activities must aim to develop or improve a product, process, software, technique, formula, or invention used in your business or held for sale.

### 4. Process of Experimentation

You must conduct research to discover technological information and intend to apply it in developing new or improved business components.

Here's the good news: you don't need to succeed. Failed experiments still count as qualified research.

## What Expenses Qualify?

Three categories of expenses can be claimed:

- **Wages:** Payments to employees for "qualified services" performed during research activities.
- **Supplies:** Tangible property used in research (excluding land, improvements to land, or depreciable property).
- **Contract Research:** 65% of amounts paid to outside contractors for qualified research.

## What Doesn't Qualify?

The IRS explicitly excludes:

- Research conducted after commercial production begins
- Adapting existing products for specific customers
- Reverse engineering from physical examination
- Routine quality control testing
- Efficiency surveys and data collection

## Major 2025 Updates

### 100% Bonus Depreciation Restored

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), signed July 4, 2025, reinstated and made permanent immediate expensing for domestic R&E expenditures. This reverses the TCJA requirement to capitalize and amortize these costs over 60 months.

### Form 6765 Section G

Section G detailed reporting requirements are now optional for tax year 2025. Beginning in 2026, it becomes mandatory for most filers. Exceptions exist for:

- Qualified small business taxpayers electing the reduced payroll tax credit
- Taxpayers with total QREs under $1.5 million and gross receipts under $50 million

### Small Business Payroll Tax Credit

Qualified small businesses can apply up to $500,000 of the R&D credit against payroll tax liability instead of income tax.

## Calculating Your Credit

The credit equals a percentage of your current-year qualified research expenses that exceed a base amount. Most businesses use the Alternative Simplified Credit (ASC) method:

**ASC = 14% x (Current Year QREs - 50% of Average QREs for Prior 3 Years)**

## Documentation Requirements

The IRS has increased scrutiny on R&D claims. Maintain these records:

- Project descriptions and objectives
- Time tracking for employees on research activities
- Supply receipts and allocation methods
- Contractor agreements and invoices
- Documentation of technical uncertainty and experimentation

## Industries That Often Overlook R&D Credits

- Manufacturing (process improvements, new product development)
- Construction (new building techniques, material testing)
- Food and beverage (recipe development, packaging innovation)
- Software development (new features, architecture improvements)
- Agriculture (crop yield optimization, equipment modifications)

## Next Steps

If your business spends money solving technical problems or improving products, you should evaluate your R&D credit eligibility. The analysis often pays for itself many times over.
