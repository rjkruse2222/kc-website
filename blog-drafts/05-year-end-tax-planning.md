# Year-End Tax Planning Checklist

*Category: Tax Strategy | Read Time: 6 minutes*

Don't wait until January to think about taxes. The moves you make before December 31st can significantly reduce your tax bill.

This checklist covers the key strategies to consider before the year ends.

## Major 2025 Tax Law Changes

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) made significant changes that affect year-end planning:

**Section 179 Expansion**
The deduction limit permanently increased to $2.5 million with a phase-out threshold of $4 million. Future years will be indexed for inflation.

**100% Bonus Depreciation Restored**
Property acquired and placed in service after January 19, 2025, qualifies for full first-year expensing. This is now permanent.

**R&E Immediate Deduction**
Domestic research and experimentation expenditures can now be immediately deducted instead of capitalized over 60 months.

**SALT Deduction Increase**
The state and local tax deduction cap increased from $10,000 to $40,000 and will continue rising 1% annually through 2029.

## Income Timing Strategies

### If You Expect Similar Tax Rates Next Year

Consider deferring income and accelerating deductions:
- Delay invoicing until January
- Prepay deductible expenses (up to 12 months)
- Make fourth quarter estimated tax payments before December 31

### If Tax Rates Will Change

The opposite strategy may apply. If you expect higher rates next year:
- Accelerate income into the current year
- Defer deductions to next year when they'll save more

## Equipment and Asset Purchases

With 100% bonus depreciation restored, equipment purchases made and placed in service by December 31 can be fully deducted this year.

Consider accelerating planned purchases if:
- You have sufficient taxable income to absorb the deduction
- The equipment will be used in your business
- You were planning to buy it anyway

Don't buy equipment you don't need just for the tax deduction. The deduction saves you 20-37 cents per dollar spent, meaning you still spend 63-80 cents net.

## Retirement Plan Contributions

### Establish New Plans
To claim a deduction for 2025, most retirement plans must be established by December 31:
- 401(k) plans
- SIMPLE IRAs
- Defined benefit plans

SEP IRAs are an exception. They can be established and funded up to your extended filing deadline.

### Maximize Contributions
Review contribution limits and ensure you're maximizing tax-advantaged retirement savings:
- 401(k) employee deferrals: $23,500 (plus $7,500 catch-up if 50+)
- SEP IRA: Up to 25% of compensation, max $70,000
- SIMPLE IRA: $16,500 (plus $3,500 catch-up if 50+)

### Employer Tax Credit
New retirement plans may qualify for a tax credit up to $5,000 annually for the cost of setting up and administering the plan.

## Employee Bonuses

If you're on the accrual method, bonuses declared by December 31 and paid within 2.5 months of year-end are deductible in the current year.

Cash-basis taxpayers must actually pay bonuses by December 31 to claim the deduction.

## Bad Debt Write-offs

Review your accounts receivable for uncollectible amounts. Write off bad debts before year-end to claim the deduction.

Document your collection efforts to support the write-off if questioned.

## Inventory Review

If you carry inventory:
- Identify obsolete or damaged goods
- Document and write down to lower of cost or market value
- Consider donating excess inventory for a deduction

## Pass-Through Entity Tax Elections

If your state offers a pass-through entity tax (PTET) election, review whether it makes sense for your situation. Most states require elections before year-end.

PTET allows the business to pay state tax at the entity level, creating a federal deduction that bypasses the SALT cap.

## Charitable Contributions

C-corporations can deduct charitable contributions up to 10% of taxable income. Pass-through entities pass contributions through to owners' personal returns.

For larger donations, consider:
- Appreciated stock (avoid capital gains, deduct full value)
- Donor-advised funds (take current deduction, distribute later)
- Qualified charitable distributions from IRAs (if 70.5+)

## Education Benefits

Employer-provided education assistance up to $5,250 per employee is tax-free to the employee and fully deductible by the business, even if the education doesn't relate to their current job.

## Energy Credits Winding Down

Some energy-related deductions have limited remaining availability:
- Commercial clean vehicle credit was disallowed as of September 2025
- Energy efficient commercial buildings deduction ends for projects starting after June 30, 2026

If you planned energy-related investments, act before these deadlines.

## Post Year-End Opportunities

Some strategies remain available after December 31:
- Retirement plan contributions (until extended filing deadline for some plans)
- Estimated tax payments (affect penalty calculations)
- Accounting method changes (filed with the return)

## The Key to Effective Planning

Year-end tax planning works best when you have current-year financials and reasonable estimates of next year's income. Work with your CPA in November or early December while there's still time to act.
