## 1. Real Estate, Construction & Trades

### Hero Section
**Tagline**: Real Estate, Construction & Trades
**Headline**: Financial Leadership That Understands Your Projects
**Subhead**: From job costing to cash flow forecasting, we provide the accounting infrastructure and strategic guidance that contractors, developers, and tradespeople need to build profitably.

### The Challenge (Section Title: "The Financial Reality of Project-Based Work")
Construction and trades businesses face financial challenges that general accountants rarely understand:

- **Cash Flow Timing**: You pay for materials and labor months before you collect. Without accurate forecasting, profitable projects can still sink your business.
- **Job Costing Complexity**: Are you actually making money on each job? Many contractors don't know until it's too late. Proper job costing reveals which projects, crews, and services drive profit.
- **Professionalising Your Business**: With exit multiples and buyouts on the rise, profressionalising your operations is the key to getting the highest multiple.
- **Multi-State Complexity**: Work across state lines creates nexus issues, varying tax requirements, and compliance headaches that compound quickly.
- **Retainage Management**: Tracking retained amounts across dozens of projects while managing the cash flow impact requires systems most contractors don't have.

### Our Approach (Section Title: "Accounting That Works Like You Do")
**Outsourced Controller & CFO Services**
You don't need a full-time CFO, but you do need CFO-level insight. Our fractional services give you:
- Weekly cash flow forecasting so you always know where you stand
- Job cost reporting that shows profit by project, phase, and crew
- WIP (Work in Progress) schedules for accurate financial statements
- Bonding support and bank-ready financials
- Budget vs. actual analysis that catches problems early

**Tax Strategy Built for Construction**
With the financial foundation in place, we layer on tax strategies specific to your industry:
- Cost segregation studies for property you own or develop

## 2. Manufacturing

### Hero Section
**Tagline**: Manufacturing
**Headline**: Financial Infrastructure for Production Excellence
**Subhead**: From inventory valuation to cost accounting, we provide the financial systems and strategic oversight that manufacturers need to understand true product costs and scale profitably.

### The Challenge (Section Title: "Manufacturing Demands Precision")
Manufacturing accounting isn't just bookkeeping. A slight miscalculation in product costing can mean the difference between healthy margins and unexpected losses:

- **Inventory Complexity**: Raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods. Each stage requires different tracking, valuation methods, and cost allocation.
- **Cost Accounting Gaps**: Many manufacturers don't have accurate visibility into true product costs, including labor, overhead, and material variances.
- **Cash Tied Up in Operations**: Inventory, receivables, and equipment purchases can consume cash faster than sales generate it.
- **Pricing Decisions in the Dark**: Without accurate cost data, pricing becomes guesswork. You may be losing money on products you think are profitable.
- **Tariffs and Supply Chain Volatility**: Material cost swings require rapid financial analysis and scenario planning.

### Our Approach (Section Title: "Financial Systems Built for Production")
**Outsourced Controller & CFO Services**
We implement and manage the financial infrastructure manufacturers need:
- Standard cost systems with variance analysis
- Inventory valuation method selection (FIFO, LIFO, weighted average) and compliance
- WIP tracking and cost flow through production stages
- Cash flow forecasting that accounts for production cycles
- KPI dashboards showing gross margin, inventory turns, and production efficiency
- Bank and investor reporting with manufacturing-appropriate metrics

**Tax Strategy for Manufacturers**
With accurate financials in place, we identify and capture tax opportunities:
- R&D tax credits for product development and process improvements
- Section 179 and bonus depreciation on equipment purchases
- Domestic Production Activities deductions where applicable
- Inventory method optimization for tax timing benefits
- State incentives for manufacturing investment

### Key Stats
- R&D credits can equal 6-8% of qualifying expenses
- Inventory method choice significantly impacts tax timing and cash flow
- Two manufacturers with identical operations can report very different margins based on accounting choices

### CTA
"Let's review your cost accounting and find the gaps."

## 3. Food & Beverage

### Hero Section
**Tagline**: Food & Beverage
**Headline**: Financial Control for Thin-Margin Operations
**Subhead**: Multi-location accounting, inventory management, and cash flow planning for restaurants, food service, and hospitality businesses operating on tight margins.

### The Challenge (Section Title: "Hospitality Runs on Razor-Thin Margins")
The food and beverage industry operates differently than almost any other business. Unique challenges require specialized financial management:

- **Rising Food Costs**: Food spoils. Portions vary. Theft happens. Without real time food costing your can't react fast enough.
- **Labor Cost Volatility**: Schedules shift weekly based on demand. Overtime creeps in. Tracking true labor costs per location or shift is complex.
- **Cash Flow Seasonality**: Sales fluctuate dramatically by season, day of week, and even weather. Cash planning requires understanding your specific patterns.
- **Multi-Location Complexity**: Each location is its own profit center. Consolidated reporting that still shows location-level performance is essential.
- **Third-Party Delivery Commissions**: Delivery platforms take 15-30% of each order. Understanding true profitability by channel matters more than ever.

### Our Approach (Section Title: "Restaurant-Ready Financial Management")
**Outsourced Controller & CFO Services**
We provide the back-office financial function that lets you focus on operations:

### CTA

## 4. Technology

### Hero Section
**Tagline**: Technology
**Headline**: Financial Infrastructure for Scale
**Subhead**: SaaS metrics, revenue recognition, and growth-stage financial leadership for technology companies building toward profitability or exit.

### The Challenge (Section Title: "Tech Finance Is Different")
Technology companies operate on different economics than traditional businesses. The metrics that matter, the accounting complexities, and the stakeholder expectations all require specialized understanding:

- **Revenue Recognition Complexity**: ASC 606 creates real challenges for SaaS, especially with implementation services, usage-based pricing, and multi-element arrangements.
- **Burn Rate Management**: Running at a loss while building toward scale requires precise cash forecasting and runway management.
- **Investor and Board Reporting**: VCs and boards expect specific metrics: MRR, ARR, churn, CAC, LTV. General accountants don't speak this language.
- **Equity Compensation**: Stock options, restricted stock, and other equity instruments create accounting and tax complexity.
- **Rapid Change**: Business models evolve quickly. Your financial systems need to keep pace.

### Our Approach (Section Title: "Financial Leadership for Growth Stage")
**Outsourced Controller & CFO Services**
We provide the financial function that growth-stage tech companies need:

## 5. Healthcare

### Hero Section
**Tagline**: Healthcare
**Headline**: Practice Management Meets Financial Strategy
**Subhead**: Revenue cycle optimization, compliance-aware accounting, and strategic financial guidance for medical practices and healthcare organizations.

### The Challenge (Section Title: "Healthcare Finance Has Unique Complexity")
Medical practices face financial challenges that general accountants simply don't understand:

- **Revenue Cycle Delays**: Unlike retail, healthcare gets paid weeks or months after service, often with adjustments, denials, and audits.
- **Payer Mix Complexity**: Medicare, Medicaid, commercial insurance, and self-pay each have different rates, timing, and compliance requirements.
- **Regulatory Burden**: HIPAA, OIG compliance, Stark Law, and ever-changing healthcare regulations require financial systems that support compliance.
- **Practice Valuation**: Whether for buy-in, buy-out, or sale, understanding practice value requires healthcare-specific methodologies.
- **Physician Compensation**: Structuring compensation that motivates productivity while maintaining compliance requires careful planning.

- Practice valuations require understanding of healthcare-specific multiples and methodologies

### CTA
"Let's review your practice finances and find opportunities."

## 6. B2B Services

### Hero Section
**Tagline**: B2B Services
**Headline**: Financial Clarity for Service-Based Growth
**Subhead**: Project accounting, utilization tracking, and strategic financial leadership for consultants, agencies, and professional service firms.

### The Challenge (Section Title: "Service Businesses Have Hidden Complexity")
Professional service firms look simple on the surface but have distinct financial challenges:

- **Utilization and Capacity**: Your inventory is people's time. Understanding utilization rates, capacity, and pricing to maximize revenue per hour is essential.
- **Project Profitability**: Which clients and projects actually make money? Many firms don't know until they build proper project accounting systems.
- **Cash Flow Timing**: Milestone billing, retainers, and delayed payments create cash flow patterns that require active management.
- **Partner Compensation**: Allocating profit among partners fairly while motivating performance requires clear financial data and agreed methodologies.
- **Scaling Challenges**: Adding headcount requires capital before new revenue materializes. Growing too fast can break cash flow.

## 7. Life Sciences

### Hero Section
**Tagline**: Life Sciences
**Headline**: Financial Leadership for the Long Development Cycle
**Subhead**: Grant accounting, clinical trial accruals, and strategic financial guidance for biotech, pharmaceutical, and medical device companies navigating from discovery to commercialization.

### The Challenge (Section Title: "Life Sciences Finance Is Highly Specialized")
Life sciences companies face accounting complexity that most firms cannot handle:

- **Investor-Driven Audit Pressure**: As funding rounds grow, so do investor demands for audited financials. Many life sciences companies aren't ready when the request comes.
- **Clinical Trial Accruals**: Accurately accruing clinical trial costs is one of the most complex areas in life sciences accounting. Getting it wrong creates audit problems.
- **Pre-Revenue Operations**: Managing burn rate and runway while operating at a loss for years requires specialized financial planning.
- **Milestone Revenue Recognition**: ASC 606 creates significant complexity for collaborative agreements and milestone-based payments.

## 8. High-Income W-2 Professionals

### Hero Section
**Tagline**: High-Income Professionals
**Headline**: Tax Planning for High Earners Who Want to Keep More
**Subhead**: Advanced tax strategies for attorneys, physicians, tech executives, and other high-income W-2 professionals who are tired of writing six-figure checks to the IRS.

### The Challenge (Section Title: "The High-Income Tax Trap")
Earning a high W-2 salary is great—until April arrives. High-income professionals face a brutal tax reality:

- **Limited Deductions**: W-2 employees have few write-offs. No business expenses, no retirement plan flexibility, no depreciation. Your taxable income is basically your gross income.
- **Bracket Creep**: At $400K+, you're paying 35-37% federal plus state taxes plus the 3.8% Net Investment Income Tax. Nearly half your raises disappear.
- **Passive Loss Limitations**: You've heard real estate can reduce taxes, but passive activity rules block most W-2 earners from using those losses.
- **SALT Cap Pain**: The $10,000 state and local tax deduction cap hits high earners in states like California, New York, and Ohio hard.
- **Excess Business Loss Limits**: Section 461(l) caps business losses at $313,000 single / $626,000 married (2025), limiting aggressive loss strategies.

### Our Approach (Section Title: "Legal Strategies That Actually Work")
**Real Estate Tax Strategies**
Real estate offers the best tax advantages for W-2 earners—if structured correctly:
- **Short-Term Rental Loophole**: Properties with average stays under 7 days aren't subject to passive activity rules. Losses can offset W-2 income directly.
- **Real Estate Professional Status**: For spouses not working full-time, qualifying as a Real Estate Professional unlocks unlimited passive loss deductions against household income.
- **Cost Segregation + Bonus Depreciation**: Accelerate depreciation on rental properties to generate large paper losses in year one.
- **Active Participation**: Even without REPS, you can deduct up to $25,000 in rental losses if you actively participate (phases out above $150K AGI, but strategies exist).

**Investment-Based Tax Planning**
Strategic investments that reduce current-year taxes:
- **Oil & Gas Working Interests**: Intangible drilling costs (IDCs) are immediately deductible and aren't subject to passive loss rules. Offset W-2 income dollar-for-dollar.
- **Conservation Easements**: Donate development rights on qualified land for deductions potentially exceeding your investment. IRS scrutiny is high—proper structure is critical.
- **Qualified Opportunity Zone Funds**: Defer capital gains and potentially eliminate tax on appreciation with 10+ year holds.
- **Tax-Efficient Asset Location**: Place tax-inefficient investments (bonds, REITs) in retirement accounts; growth stocks in taxable accounts.

**Charitable Strategies**
Turn charitable intent into tax efficiency:
- **Donor-Advised Funds**: Bunch multiple years of giving into one year to exceed the standard deduction threshold. Get the deduction now, distribute to charities over time.
- **Appreciated Stock Donations**: Donate stock instead of cash to avoid capital gains and still get the full fair market value deduction.
- **Charitable Remainder Trusts**: Convert highly appreciated assets into lifetime income while getting an immediate deduction.

**Income Timing & Structure**
- **Backdoor Roth Conversions**: High earners can still fund Roth IRAs through the backdoor strategy—no income limits apply.
- **Deferred Compensation Planning**: If available, defer income to lower-tax years (retirement, relocation, sabbatical).
- **Multi-Year Tax Projections**: Plan stock option exercises, bonuses, and large transactions across tax years to minimize bracket exposure.

**Business Ownership Planning**
Own a piece of equipment-intensive businesses that pay for themselves while generating tax losses:
- **Leverage + Depreciation**: Finance equipment that cash flows from day one. The business covers the debt service while you claim 100% bonus depreciation on the full purchase price—creating paper losses that offset W-2 income.
- **Material Participation**: Meet the 100-hour test (participate at least 100 hours annually and more than any other individual) to treat the activity as non-passive. Your losses then offset active income directly.
- **Asset Classes That Work**: Car washes, crypto mining, laundromats, self-storage, equipment leasing—businesses where the equipment does the work and financing is readily available.
- **Cash Flow Positive, Tax Loss Negative**: The math works because depreciation is a non-cash expense. You pocket the operating income while the depreciation deduction shelters your W-2.

### Key Stats
- Short-term rentals can generate hundreds of thousands in year-one paper losses
- Oil & gas IDCs are 60-80% deductible in year one
- Section 461(l) limits excess business losses to $305K single / $610K married (2024)
- Bonus depreciation: 100% in 2026
